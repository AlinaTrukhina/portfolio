    <h1>Foraging Finds</h1>

    <h3>Duration: 2 Week Sprint</h3>

    <p>Finding plants or mushrooms when you are out foraging is a joy! 
        However, remembering the spot you found that beautiful flush of chanterelles some time after can be frustrating. 
        This app lets foragers save their finds on a map along with a photo and a short journal entry. </p>

    <p>Users can also explore other users finds or search for a specific mushroom on a map, and leave a comment on each entry. 
        All user entries can be viewed in a list, edited, or deleted.</p>
